## Intro

This is afq's little Runge-Kutta library. It's designed for nonlinear
DAEs and multiphysics couplings. It was programmed for the paper

which presents the algorithms in detail. I've used this library for
everything from particle methods, finite element methods,
contact-driven problems, etc. There's room for improvement, but it works.
